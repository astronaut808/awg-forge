# AWG-Forge

[README на русском](README.md)

Self-hosted AmneziaWG control panel for Docker: Go backend, embedded Web UI, and CLI for tunnels, clients, diagnostics, backup/restore, and safe maintenance.

![awg-forge dashboard](docs/assets/awg-forge-dashboard.jpg)

## Why AWG-Forge

- Ready-to-run Docker-based setup: backend, Web UI, CLI, and runtime tools are shipped together.
- Safe default for the panel: the Web UI listens on `127.0.0.1`, not on the server's public interface.
- Multiple independent tunnels on one VPS: different profiles, UDP ports, and egress scenarios without manually editing Docker port mappings.
- Flexible IPv4 egress: a tunnel can exit directly through the server or through Cloudflare WARP.
- Multiple AmneziaWG generations: stable profiles through 2.0 and a built-in experimental AWG 3.x profile without changing the production default.
- Management and maintenance in one place: daily actions through the Web UI, diagnostics and automation through the CLI.

## Supported

- Stable AmneziaWG profiles: Legacy / 1.0, 1.5-oriented profile, and 2.0. New installations default to 2.0.
- AWG 3.x is included in the standard image as an experimental profile with an explicit UI warning. Enable and use it at your own risk; AmneziaWG 2.0 remains the production default. The verified AWG 3.x import paths are downloaded `.conf` files and the AmneziaWG QR.
- Tunnels: separate profiles, UDP ports, subnets, endpoint settings, and IPv4 egress.
- IPv6 egress is not supported yet; generated client configs intentionally use `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0` without `::/0`.
- Egress: `Server WAN` or Cloudflare WARP per tunnel.
- Web UI TLS: loopback HTTP, reverse proxy, manual certificates, or managed ACME for one public domain or short-lived public IP certificate.
- Clients: create, enable/disable, expiration, delete, and profile-dependent import through `.conf`, AmneziaWG QR, AmneziaVPN QR, or `vpn://`.
- Diagnostics: Doctor, firewall repair, client status, last seen, received/sent counters.
- Maintenance Center: Doctor with contextual firewall repair, WARP, backup/restore verification, traffic, audit log, and support diagnostics.

## Quick Start

Interactive install on Linux/VPS (Docker required):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer checks Docker before creating files, creates `/opt/awg-forge`, generates `.env`, password, and `SESSION_SECRET`, enables SQLite, creates the first tunnel in `state.json`, applies the initial SQLite migration, starts Docker Compose, and prints the SSH tunnel command. New installs default to AmneziaWG 2.0 for the first tunnel.

Update a managed installation with the installer from `master`. It matches the current release and contains that release's compatibility checks and migrations.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo AWG_FORGE_HOME=/opt/awg-forge ./install.sh upgrade
```

For an installation outside `/opt/awg-forge`, set its directory: `sudo AWG_FORGE_HOME=/srv/awg-forge ./install.sh upgrade`. A regular run from the managed installation directory also detects it and offers `Upgrade` in its menu.

By default the Web UI listens on `127.0.0.1:51821`. Open it through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 51821:127.0.0.1:51821 user@server
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:51821
```

## Manual Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astronaut808/awg-forge.git
cd awg-forge
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p data
docker compose run --rm --no-deps awg-forge init \
  --server-host vpn.example.com \
  --external-interface eth0 \
  --profile awg_2_0 \
  --tunnel-name awg20 \
  --listen-port 51830 \
  --ipv4-subnet 10.20.0.0/24
docker compose run --rm --no-deps awg-forge db migrate
docker compose up -d
```

Replace the example host, interface, port, and subnet before running `init`. They create the first persistent tunnel in `data/state.json`; changing legacy tunnel variables in `.env` afterwards does not update it.

Docker host networking is the recommended production mode. It lets tunnels created in the UI use different UDP ports without editing Docker port mappings.

## Important Settings

- `.env` stores container and Web UI runtime settings; tunnels are stored in `data/state.json`.
- `EXTERNAL_INTERFACE` is the server external interface for WAN egress.
- `WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1` is the safe default for SSH tunnel access.
- `APPLY_CONFIG=true` applies runtime tunnels and firewall rules.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=auto|true|false` controls the Web UI Secure cookie policy.

Change a tunnel endpoint from `Tunnel settings` -> `Server host`. If an upgraded `.env` still contains old tunnel variables such as `SERVER_HOST`, `LISTEN_PORT`, or `IPV4_SUBNET`, you can remove them after verifying tunnel settings in the UI.

WARP can be selected while creating a tunnel or enabled later from `Tunnel settings` -> `Egress` -> `Cloudflare WARP`. If WARP is not configured yet, AWG-Forge registers the shared `warp0` automatically. See [Configuration](docs/en/configuration.md).

## Startup Check

1. Create a client in the UI.
2. Open the client's `Config` and use one of the offered import methods. AWG 3.x provides `.conf` download and AmneziaWG QR only.
3. Check IPv4 egress:

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.co
```

Doctor:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

## Uninstall

Always run the current `uninstall.sh` from `master`. It contains cleanup logic for current and legacy rule formats.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
```

Preview the uninstall plan:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash -s -- --dry-run --yes
```

Backup/restore, firewall repair, support bundle, and audit log are available from `Maintenance Center` and CLI. Upstream-ref checks are available through the CLI command `awg-forge updates`.

## Development

```bash
make ci
```

Run locally without applying runtime tunnel changes:

```bash
CONFIG_DIR=/private/tmp/awg-forge-dev \
WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
WEBUI_PORT=51821 \
PASSWORD=test \
APPLY_CONFIG=false \
go run ./cmd/awg-forge serve
```

Runtime and Docker image do not require Node/npm. The Web UI is built from `web/` with Vite/Preact/TypeScript and embedded into the Go binary as static files.
