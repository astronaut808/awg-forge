# Configuration

The main example is [.env.example](../../.env.example).

## Common Variables

- `WEBUI_HOST`: Web UI bind address. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
- `WEBUI_PORT`: Web UI port. Defaults to `51821`.
- `PASSWORD`: Web UI password. Required for public binds and recommended always.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`: Secure cookie policy for UI sessions. Values: `auto`, `true`, `false`. Defaults to `auto`.
- `WEBUI_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`: permits trusted `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` handling. Defaults to `false`.
- `WEBUI_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`: comma-separated CIDRs allowed to supply forwarded headers. Required when `WEBUI_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`.
- `EXTERNAL_INTERFACE`: server egress interface, often `eth0` or `ens3`. In bridge networking this is usually `eth0` inside the container.
- `APPLY_CONFIG`: when `true`, awg-forge applies runtime tunnel changes with AmneziaWG tools.
- `PUBLISHED_UDP_PORTS`: published Docker UDP ports/ranges, for example `51820-51840,7443`.
- `TUNNEL_UDP_PORT_RANGE`: range used for automatic tunnel port selection. Defaults to `30000-49999`. In bridge mode, automatic selection is limited to the overlap with `PUBLISHED_UDP_PORTS`.
- `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`: enables the safe audit log. Defaults to `true`.
- `AUDIT_LOG_PATH`: audit log path. Defaults to `/etc/awg-forge/audit.log`.
- `AUDIT_LOG_MAX_SIZE`: file size before rotation. Defaults to `5242880`.
- `AUDIT_LOG_MAX_FILES`: number of rotated files to keep. Defaults to `3`.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: runtime log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. Defaults to `info`.
- `DATABASE_MODE`: operational database mode. Values: `off`, `sqlite`, `postgres`. The application default is `off`; fresh installs use `sqlite`; `postgres` is reserved for future support.
- `DATABASE_PATH`: SQLite database path. Defaults to `/etc/awg-forge/awg-forge.db`.
- `DATABASE_RETENTION_DAYS`: default operational data retention window. Defaults to `90`.
- `DATABASE_BUSY_TIMEOUT`: SQLite busy timeout. Defaults to `5s`.
- `DATABASE_QUERY_TIMEOUT`: database command/query timeout. Defaults to `2s`.
- `DATABASE_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`: database connection limit. Defaults to `1`.
- `DATABASE_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`: idle connection limit. Defaults to `1`.

## First Tunnel Initialization

New installs keep runtime settings in `.env` and tunnel settings in `state.json`.

During a fresh install, `install.sh` runs a one-shot `awg-forge init` container before starting the service. That command creates `data/state.json` with the selected first tunnel. After that, `docker compose up -d` starts from ready state, and tunnel settings are managed from the Web UI/API and persisted in `state.json`.

The installer asks for the protocol profile before tunnel defaults, so profile-specific defaults stay aligned. Pressing Enter on the profile question selects AWG 2.0. The installer selects a free UDP port from `30000-49999` by default; the profile ports below remain the defaults for manual selection:

| Profile | Tunnel name | Port | Subnet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `awg_legacy_1_0` | `awg0` | `51820` | `10.8.0.0/24` |
| `awg_1_5` | `awg15` | `51825` | `10.15.0.0/24` |
| `awg_2_0` | `awg20` | `51830` | `10.20.0.0/24` |

When creating more tunnels in the Web UI, automatic port selection uses a free port from the effective range. Ports below `1024` and common infrastructure ports are excluded from automatic selection. The selected port is stored normally in `state.json`; it is not rotated after creation. Manual selection remains available, and backend validation rejects conflicts.

If you upgrade from an older awg-forge version and `.env` still contains `SERVER_HOST`, `LISTEN_PORT`, `IPV4_SUBNET`, `DNS`, `ALLOWED_IPS`, `PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE`, `MTU`, or `PROTOCOL_PROFILE`, those values are ignored after `state.json` exists. Verify tunnel settings in the UI, then remove old tunnel variables from `.env` to avoid confusion.

## SESSION_SECRET

`SESSION_SECRET` is optional. If omitted, awg-forge creates and persists one in `state.json`.

It is used to sign UI session cookies. In the normal setup, users do not need to manage it manually.

## SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE

`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` controls the `Secure` flag on UI session cookies:

- `auto`: default. For `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, and `::1`, cookies work over HTTP without `Secure`; for external hosts, cookies use `Secure`.
- `true`: always set `Secure`. Use with HTTPS/reverse proxies.
- `false`: never set `Secure`. This allows login through `http://domain:port`, but is unsafe on the public internet.

If you need plain HTTP Web UI access, use it only on a trusted network or behind separate protection. For production, prefer `WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1` with SSH tunneling or HTTPS.

## Web UI TLS

TLS desired configuration is stored only in `CONFIG_DIR/tls/config.json`, separate from VPN `state.json` and the ACME cache. The built-in modes are:

- `off`: current HTTP workflow for loopback or SSH tunneling;
- `reverse-proxy`: Caddy, Nginx, or another proxy terminates HTTPS;
- `manual`: awg-forge serves a provided certificate chain and private key.
- `acme-domain`: awg-forge obtains and renews a certificate for one public DNS name with HTTP-01.
- `acme-ip`: awg-forge obtains and renews a short-lived certificate for one public IP with HTTP-01.

DNS-01, wildcard certificates, and TLS-ALPN-01 are not implemented.

### ACME Domain TLS

Use this mode only when the domain's A/AAAA records reach this host and external TCP port `80` is available. HTTP-01 is always served on port `80`; the Web UI itself remains on `WEBUI_PORT`, including a non-default port. awg-forge never opens host firewall or provider security-group rules automatically.

For a fresh managed installation, select **ACME certificate** in `install.sh`. The installer then proposes the public IPv4 wildcard bind `0.0.0.0`; you can enter an exact public bind address instead. On an existing installation, first set a public `WEBUI_HOST` in `.env`, keep `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=auto` or `true`, and keep `WEBUI_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false`. Recreate the container so the CLI validates that deployment context, then configure ACME:

```bash
cd /opt/awg-forge
# Edit .env: WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0 and WEBUI_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls use acme-domain \
  --domain panel.example.com \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --accept-tos
docker restart awg-forge
```

The mode requires a non-loopback `WEBUI_HOST`, `PASSWORD`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=auto` or `true`, and disabled trusted proxy headers. The HTTP listener serves only ACME challenges for the configured domain; other requests receive `404`. Normal requests for that domain redirect to `https://panel.example.com:WEBUI_PORT/`.

The installer starts the service without waiting for certificate issuance. The first HTTPS request for the configured domain triggers issuance; this avoids making installation depend on temporary CA or network availability. Until then, `doctor`, `tls status`, and Maintenance -> Support report `pending`; after a successful request they report the active cached certificate. They cannot prove that port `80` is reachable from the public Internet.

### ACME IP TLS

Use this only for the server's publicly routed IPv4 or IPv6 address. Let's Encrypt IP certificates use the `shortlived` profile and are valid for about six days; awg-forge starts renewal 72 hours before expiry. Domain names, private addresses, loopback addresses, and DNS-01 are not accepted by this mode.

The requirements are the same as domain HTTP-01: a non-loopback `WEBUI_HOST`, `PASSWORD`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=auto` or `true`, disabled trusted proxy headers, and externally reachable TCP/80. The Web UI bind must match the certificate IP family: use `WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0` (or the exact address) for IPv4 and `WEBUI_HOST=::` (or the exact address) for IPv6. This deliberately does not rely on dual-stack wildcard behavior. For a fresh installation, the installer asks for the certificate IP first and proposes the matching bind automatically. It only enables IPv6 for the Web UI listener and certificate; tunnel IPv6 egress and client IPv6 addressing remain unsupported. Configure an existing installation with:

```bash
cd /opt/awg-forge
# Set WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0 for IPv4, or WEBUI_HOST=:: for IPv6 in .env.
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls use acme-ip \
  --ip <public-ipv4-or-ipv6> --email admin@example.com --accept-tos
docker restart awg-forge
```

The running service starts the first issuance attempt immediately after its HTTPS and HTTP-01 listeners are ready. It does not fall back to public HTTP if issuance fails. `tls status`, `doctor`, and Maintenance show a safe failure state and the next retry time. Retries use a bounded backoff, so correcting the address or TCP/80 path does not require a restart.

ACME account material and certificates live in `CONFIG_DIR/tls/acme` with directory mode `0700`. They are included only in the encrypted awg-forge backup, never in the support bundle. Certificate renewal is managed by the running process.

#### ACME issuance problems and recovery

If certificate issuance fails, awg-forge does not fall back to a public HTTP UI. The HTTPS handshake fails until the problem is fixed; this prevents a Secure session from silently being downgraded to HTTP. Check the configured state first:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls status
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

For domain mode, verify that the exact A/AAAA records resolve to this host. For IP mode, verify that the configured public IP is routed to this host. In both modes, verify that inbound TCP/80 reaches the host and that another service or proxy is not already using port `80`. After correction, the running service retries automatically at the time reported by `tls status` and Doctor.

To restore SSH-only access instead, use the recovery procedure below. It also works when the main container is restarting and `docker exec` is unavailable.

To stop public ACME access and return the panel to SSH-only access, disable TLS before changing `WEBUI_HOST` to loopback:

```bash
cd /opt/awg-forge
docker compose run --rm --no-deps awg-forge tls disable
# Set WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1 in .env, then:
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

`docker compose run` also works when the main container is restarting because it starts a separate one-shot CLI container with the same `data/` volume. Re-running `install.sh` and choosing **Reconfigure** offers this step automatically when it detects ACME TLS and a loopback bind.

### Manual TLS

The private key must be a regular file with mode `0600` in a `0700` directory; symbolic links are rejected. awg-forge verifies PEM parsing, certificate/key matching, certificate validity, and the configured server name against the certificate SAN before listening. It does not fall back to HTTP when manual TLS validation fails.

Save the validated manual configuration through the container CLI:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls use manual \
  --cert /mnt/awg-forge-tls/fullchain.pem \
  --key /mnt/awg-forge-tls/privkey.pem \
  --server-name panel.example.com
docker restart awg-forge
```

All TLS modes, including `off`, are stored in `CONFIG_DIR/tls/config.json` with mode `0600`. It is the sole TLS configuration source; `.env` only provides deployment context such as the Web UI bind address, session-cookie policy, and trusted proxy CIDRs.

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls disable
docker restart awg-forge
```

`tls status` reports configured settings; `Maintenance` -> `Support` reports the TLS runtime loaded by the current process.

For a manual certificate outside `./data`, add an explicit read-only mount to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/etc/awg-forge
  - /srv/awg-forge/manual-tls:/mnt/awg-forge-tls:ro
```

The encrypted backup preserves `tls/config.json` and the built-in ACME cache. It does not copy certificate or key files supplied through an external mount; retain those files separately.

Check the active mode and safe certificate metadata without printing PEM or key paths:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls status
```

The same safe mode, certificate, and trusted-proxy summary is available in `Maintenance` -> `Support` without PEM, private keys, or file paths.

### Reverse Proxy

Keep `WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1` where possible and configure HTTPS in the proxy. When moving from ACME or manual TLS, first save `off` through a one-shot CLI container:

```bash
cd /opt/awg-forge
docker compose run --rm --no-deps awg-forge tls disable
```

Then enable trusted forwarded headers and explicit proxy CIDRs in `.env`:

```env
WEBUI_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true
WEBUI_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=127.0.0.1/32,::1/128
```

Reload the runtime configuration, save reverse-proxy mode, then restart so the current process reloads the TLS file:

```bash
cd /opt/awg-forge
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tls use reverse-proxy
docker restart awg-forge
```

The proxy must preserve the request `Host` and send `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. awg-forge accepts only `http` or `https` from a direct peer in the configured CIDRs; spoofed headers from normal clients are ignored. The resolved scheme controls `Secure` cookies and Origin/Referer validation.

## EXTERNAL_INTERFACE

To find the server egress interface:

```bash
ip route get 1.1.1.1
```

Example:

```text
1.1.1.1 via 203.0.113.1 dev ens3 src 203.0.113.10
```

Then use:

```env
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE=ens3
```

If the interface is wrong, handshakes may work while internet through the VPN does not.

## Tunnel Endpoint

Each tunnel has a `Server host` field in the Web UI. It defines the host awg-forge uses in `Endpoint = <host>:<port>` for client `.conf` files.

On new installs this value is written to `state.json` during the first `awg-forge init`. Changing `SERVER_HOST` in `.env` after state exists does not rewrite existing tunnels.

This is useful when different tunnels are published through different subdomains, for example:

```text
legacy.example.com:44865
awg20.example.com:44867
```

Important:

- `Server host` must not include a scheme, path, or port;
- the port comes from the tunnel settings;
- after changing the host, clients should re-import a fresh config from `Config`;
- already imported clients do not update themselves.

## MTU

`MTU=0` in a tunnel means awg-forge does not add `MTU = ...` to server/client configs.

If you explicitly set tunnel MTU, it is rendered exactly the same into server and client configs. awg-forge does not use hidden MTU decisions.

Practically:

- `Auto` is a good starting point;
- `1280` often helps on problematic networks, mobile networks, routers, and complex routes;
- the Web UI offers `Auto`, common presets, and `Custom` for explicit MTU values;
- after changing MTU, clients should re-import a fresh config from `Config`.

## IPv6 and AllowedIPs

The current awg-forge release manages IPv4 egress. Generated client configs intentionally use:

```ini
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```

`::/0` is not added automatically because the server side does not yet create IPv6 subnets, client IPv6 addresses, IPv6 forwarding, or NAT66/ip6tables/nftables rules. Adding `::/0` without full IPv6 egress could send client IPv6 traffic into the tunnel and blackhole it.

If you need IPv6 leak protection before full IPv6 support lands, disable IPv6 on the client/router or configure IPv4-only behavior on the client side.

## Tunnel Egress and WARP

Each tunnel can use one of two egress modes:

- `Server WAN`: client traffic leaves through the server external interface from `EXTERNAL_INTERFACE`;
- `Cloudflare WARP`: client traffic leaves through a shared `warp0` outbound interface.

WARP is not an AmneziaWG protocol profile. It is an outbound routing mode for existing tunnels. This means Legacy / 1.0, AWG 1.5, and AWG 2.0 tunnels can independently choose WAN or WARP egress.

Recommended flow:

1. Select `Cloudflare WARP` in the `Egress` field while creating a tunnel, or open `Tunnel settings` for an existing tunnel.
2. Change `Egress` from `Server WAN` to `Cloudflare WARP`.
3. Click `Create tunnel` or `Save`.

If WARP is not configured yet, awg-forge automatically registers Cloudflare WARP, creates the shared outbound `warp0` interface, applies runtime routing/NAT, and then switches the tunnel to WARP egress.

`Maintenance` -> `WARP` is for operations: checking status, manually registering or re-registering WARP, restarting `warp0`, deleting WARP config, or importing a config manually.

Manual import is only a fallback when you already have a Cloudflare WARP WireGuard/AmneziaWG config from an external generator or WARP client tool. In that case, open `Manual WARP config import`, paste the full config, and click `Import WARP config`.

Existing client configs do not need to change when only egress mode changes, because the client still connects to the same AmneziaWG tunnel endpoint. Runtime routing/NAT changes on the server side.

Doctor checks WARP runtime, policy rules, and WARP-aware firewall expectations for WARP-enabled tunnels.

## Experimental AWG 3.x profile

AWG 3.x is included in the standard Docker image as one experimental profile. Selecting it in the Web UI is the explicit opt-in: the upstream 3.x implementation is still evolving, so enable and use the complete profile at your own risk. Existing tunnels are not converted, and AWG 2.0 remains the default and supported production profile.

The image pins `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260828 and `amneziawg-tools` 3.1.20260812, forces AWG 3.x through userspace, and exposes the `awg_3` profile without a separate environment flag, image, or Compose override. Versions before `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260814 are not supported because a cookie reply with `RandomTrailers` could terminate the process. The pinned 3.1.20260828 runtime also contains the current upstream UDP-window padding and `DisableCookies` under-load fixes. The profile reuses the same generated QUIC Initial-like `I1` mechanism as AWG 2.0.

Use downloaded `.conf` files or the AmneziaWG QR, which encodes the same raw `.conf`. AmneziaVPN QR and `vpn://` remain disabled until those formats are verified independently. AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5 is the minimum supported target for AWG 3.1 interoperability; do not use 5.0.0.5.

The generated Header Protection defaults use the upstream compatibility values `H1=1`, `H2=2`, `H3=3`, and `H4=4`, with every `S1-S4` value at least `12`. `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies` default to `off`. The server runtime config keeps explicit `off` values so a live `syncconf` update can clear a previously enabled option, while client exports omit disabled options. If `RandomTrailers` is enabled for controlled testing, upstream recommends equal `S1-S4` values; keep it off while the open transport-classification and first-packet issues remain unresolved. `DisableCookies` suppresses outgoing Cookie Reply messages only; incoming cookie processing and the remaining WireGuard cookie logic stay active. This still reduces handshake-flood protection, so keep it off outside controlled testing.

When an explicit tunnel MTU is configured, awg-forge writes the same value to both server and client `.conf` files. For AWG 3.x interoperability testing, use `1280` as the conservative fallback instead of `Auto` when the path MTU is unknown. Some current AmneziaVPN import paths can replace a server-provided MTU with a platform default; that upstream fix is still pending, so verify the effective MTU on both ends when a handshake succeeds but large packets stall.

Manual end-to-end testing has confirmed `.conf` import, handshake, traffic, restart recovery, WAN egress, and WARP egress with compatible AmneziaVPN, AmneziaWG, and DefaultVPN clients. This does not guarantee compatibility with every platform, client build, network, or future 3.x runtime.

Before downgrading to a release that does not support `awg_3`, download any required client configs and remove all AWG 3.x tunnels. Older binaries cannot interpret that profile in `state.json`.

## APPLY_CONFIG

When `APPLY_CONFIG=true`, mutating operations update state/config files and apply changes to runtime.

If runtime apply fails, awg-forge rolls back state and rendered configs. The UI shows the apply error and should not keep a client or tunnel that failed to apply.

For local development:

```env
APPLY_CONFIG=false
```

## Audit Log

The audit log stores safe operational events: login success/failure, client create/update/delete, tunnel create/update/delete/restart, firewall repair, backup/support/restore verify, and update checks.

It is meant for cases like “it worked yesterday, then settings changed, now handshakes exist but internet does not work”.

In the Web UI, `Maintenance` -> `Audit log` auto-refreshes while that tab is open and displays newest events first.

The audit log must not contain:

- private keys;
- preshared keys;
- passwords;
- session secrets;
- full client configs;
- import keys or `vpn://`;
- raw protocol parameter values.

Read recent events:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --tail 200
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --level error
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --event tunnel.apply.failed
```

## Runtime Logs

Runtime logs are structured JSON written to the container stderr and read with Docker. They are for service lifecycle, runtime apply failures, WARP/firewall operations, traffic-history failures, and HTTP errors. They are separate from the persistent audit trail.

```bash
docker compose logs -f awg-forge
docker compose logs --tail 200 awg-forge
docker compose logs --no-log-prefix awg-forge | jq 'select(.level == "ERROR")'
```

Use `LOG_LEVEL=debug` only while investigating a problem, then return it to `info` and recreate the container. Debug adds operational context but uses the same secret redaction rules. Runtime logs never contain passwords, session cookies, private keys, preshared keys, full configs, QR payloads, request bodies, or query strings.

New managed Compose files use Docker's `local` log driver with a `10m` size and three retained files. Custom Compose deployments keep their own logging-driver policy.

## Operational Database

The application default for a missing `DATABASE_MODE` is `off`, which keeps existing installations file-based and does not create a database. Fresh installs created by the current installer use `DATABASE_MODE=sqlite`; existing installations remain unchanged unless SQLite is explicitly enabled during `install.sh upgrade`.

`DATABASE_MODE=sqlite` enables local operational history for indexed audit events and traffic usage. It keeps JSONL as the reliable local audit trail. The schema reserves tables for login, health, and TLS history, but those records are not collected yet. It does not move `state.json`, private keys, WARP tokens, raw configs, QR payloads, or import links into the database.

Initialize or upgrade the local schema:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge db migrate
```

Check database status:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge db status
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

Apply retention cleanup:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge db retention apply
```

SQLite uses a local file under `CONFIG_DIR`, with WAL mode, foreign keys enabled, and `0600` file permissions. Do not place this database on a network filesystem.

When SQLite is enabled and migrated, audit events are written to both the existing JSONL audit log and `audit_events`. `Maintenance` -> `Audit log` and `awg-forge logs` merge SQLite and JSONL events, then fall back to JSONL if SQLite is unavailable. This prevents SQLite mirror issues from hiding events that reached `audit.log`.

When SQLite is enabled, migrated, and `APPLY_CONFIG=true`, awg-forge samples runtime transfer counters once per minute and stores daily client traffic aggregates. The first sample establishes the baseline and is not counted as transferred traffic. Client rows show total recorded traffic, and `Maintenance` -> `Traffic` shows aggregate totals for today, 7 days, and 30 days across clients and tunnels.

Client creation and client settings can store an optional traffic limit when SQLite is enabled. The Web UI accepts MiB, GiB, or TiB. A limit can apply to all recorded traffic (`Lifetime`) or to the previous 30 UTC days (`Rolling 30 days (UTC)`); existing limits remain lifetime limits after migration. Unlimited means no limit row is stored.

When recorded traffic reaches or exceeds the configured limit, awg-forge disables the client through the normal render/apply path and writes an audit event. Re-enable attempts are rejected while the active limit period is exceeded. The rolling window moves forward as daily UTC aggregates age out. awg-forge automatically re-enables only clients it disabled for that quota; a manual disable clears the quota-block marker and is never auto-reversed. The HTTP API returns `409 Conflict`; the CLI returns an error.
