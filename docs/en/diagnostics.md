# Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

## Doctor

Run:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

Doctor output is grouped by diagnostic category: system, security, database, network, firewall, tunnels, clients, and WARP.

Doctor checks:

- root/capabilities;
- `/dev/net/tun`;
- `awg`, `awg-quick`, `amneziawg-go`;
- `iptables`, `ip`, `nf_tables`;
- session cookie security policy;
- Web UI TLS mode, manual or cached ACME certificate validity, and trusted proxy configuration;
- optional database mode, schema, and journal mode;
- exceeded client traffic limits when SQLite is enabled;
- IPv4 forwarding;
- external interface;
- IPv4 egress route and `EXTERNAL_INTERFACE` match;
- `rp_filter` for host/default/external/tunnel interfaces;
- config directory permissions;
- WARP config, runtime link, and policy rules for WARP-enabled tunnels;
- UDP listen ports;
- UDP listener inspection through `ss`;
- Docker published UDP port ranges;
- rendered server configs;
- runtime config `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/<interface>.conf`;
- `awg-quick strip` for runtime config validation;
- runtime tunnel links;
- runtime `awg show` listen ports;
- NAT/FORWARD firewall rules;
- runtime peers;
- stale client configs;
- handshakes and transfer counters.

## AmneziaWG and WARP Diagnostics

Use the checks below to distinguish three observable states: no incoming UDP packet, no handshake after a packet arrives, and no egress after a handshake.

WARP egress is applied on the server after traffic reaches the VPS. It does not change the AmneziaWG endpoint configured on the client. Cloudflare's proxied DNS mode does not proxy arbitrary UDP; use a DNS-only record for an AmneziaWG endpoint.

Do not paste private keys or complete client configs into diagnostics reports.

### UDP Does Not Reach the Server

On the server, capture only the tunnel port while reproducing one connection attempt:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -ni <external-interface> "udp dst port <listen-port>"
```

If no packets arrive on the selected interface:

- compare the endpoint DNS result with the expected VPS IP;
- ensure the endpoint DNS record is not Cloudflare-proxied;
- check the provider security group when one is configured;
- verify the port and endpoint in a freshly downloaded client `.conf`;
- repeat from another network and record the result.

### UDP Arrives but There Is No Handshake

After packets are visible on the external interface, confirm that the service receives them:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge ss -lunp
docker inspect awg-forge --format '{{.HostConfig.NetworkMode}}'
docker port awg-forge
```

`docker port` is relevant only for bridge networking. Then run:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

Doctor reports runtime peers, handshakes, and transfer counters without exposing protocol secrets. Do not publish raw `awg show` output without redaction: AWG 3.x output includes `HeaderProtectionKey`, while `awg show <interface> dump` can also contain the interface private key and preshared keys. AWG-Forge is the source for the selected profile, stale-config status, and whether a fresh client config is needed after client-facing tunnel changes. For AmneziaWG 2.0, use the `.conf` import fallback when the target client has compatibility limitations.

Record the network, time, client version, and packet-capture result before changing settings.

### Handshake Exists but Internet Does Not Work

Follow [No Internet Through VPN](#no-internet-through-vpn) and compare the tunnel counters with the managed `FORWARD` and `POSTROUTING` counters.

If WARP egress is selected, Doctor also checks the WARP runtime and policy rules.

### Only Some Networks Fail

Use the same client, fresh config, endpoint, and time window on a working and failing network. Record the observed state:

- DNS resolution;
- UDP reaching the VPS;
- handshake completion;
- a later egress failure; or
- degradation after sustained traffic.

### WARP Is Enabled but the Endpoint Is Unreachable

WARP begins after the client's encrypted tunnel has reached the VPS. Check the client-to-VPS path first; WARP diagnostics are relevant after a handshake is possible.

## Support Bundle

Support bundles are meant for sharing diagnostics without private keys or full configs.

In the UI, open `Maintenance` -> `Support` to download a `.zip`.

In Docker:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge support-bundle
```

With an explicit file name:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge support-bundle /tmp/awg-forge-support.zip
docker cp awg-forge:/tmp/awg-forge-support.zip .
```

The bundle includes:

- redacted config/state summary;
- Doctor results;
- database status metadata when the optional operational database is configured;
- runtime `ip` and `iptables` output; peer, handshake, and transfer diagnostics come from the redacted Doctor report;
- config directory inventory without `.conf` contents.

The bundle should not include:

- private keys;
- preshared keys;
- password;
- session secret;
- rendered server/client configs;
- import keys, `vpn://` links, QR payloads, or packed AmneziaVPN QR strings;
- database table rows;
- raw protocol parameter values.

The bundle also includes `audit-log.redacted.jsonl`: recent audit events with secret-looking fields already redacted.

## Audit Log

The audit log helps reconstruct the event timeline: a client was created, tunnel settings changed, a fresh config was downloaded, firewall repair ran, backup was created, or an apply error happened.

Commands:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --tail 200
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --level warn
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --event tunnel.settings.updated
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge logs --json
```

The audit log lives at `CONFIG_DIR/audit.log`, defaults to `/etc/awg-forge/audit.log`, uses `0600`, and rotates locally.

For current service failures, inspect runtime JSON logs separately:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail 200 awg-forge
docker compose logs --no-log-prefix awg-forge | jq 'select(.level == "ERROR" or .level == "WARN")'
```

Do not publish raw container logs. They are redacted, but may still expose operational metadata such as tunnel identifiers and interface names.

When troubleshooting “connected but no internet”, useful events include:

- `tunnel.settings.updated`;
- `tunnel.protocol.updated`;
- `client.config.downloaded`;
- `tunnel.apply.failed`;
- `firewall.repaired`;
- `doctor.completed`.

## Encrypted Backup / Restore

Backups are different from support bundles: they contain secret material, including `state.json`, private keys, preshared keys, and rendered `.conf` files.

Backups are always encrypted with a dedicated password:

```bash
docker exec -e BACKUP_PASSWORD='long-random-backup-password' awg-forge awg-forge backup /tmp/awg-forge.afbackup
docker cp awg-forge:/tmp/awg-forge.afbackup ./awg-forge-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.afbackup
```

Restore requires the same password:

```bash
docker cp ./<backup-file>.afbackup awg-forge:/tmp/backup.afbackup
docker exec -e BACKUP_PASSWORD='long-random-backup-password' awg-forge awg-forge restore verify /tmp/backup.afbackup
docker exec -e BACKUP_PASSWORD='long-random-backup-password' awg-forge awg-forge restore /tmp/backup.afbackup
```

`docker exec` can only see files inside the container filesystem. If the backup is on the host, copy it into the container with `docker cp` first, as shown above. Alternatively, place it in the mounted volume:

```bash
cp ./<backup-file>.afbackup ./data/backup.afbackup
docker exec -e BACKUP_PASSWORD='long-random-backup-password' awg-forge awg-forge restore verify /etc/awg-forge/backup.afbackup
docker exec -e BACKUP_PASSWORD='long-random-backup-password' awg-forge awg-forge restore /etc/awg-forge/backup.afbackup
```

`restore verify` decrypts and validates the backup, renders server and client configs in memory, and prints a redacted summary. It does not write to the config directory, create a pre-restore backup, restart tunnels, or change runtime state.

In the UI, open `Maintenance` -> `Backup & restore` to upload an `.afbackup` file and run the same verification as a dry-run. Actual restore remains CLI-only.

Before replacing the current config directory, restore keeps an encrypted pre-restore backup in `backups/` inside the restored config directory.

Restore checks:

- password and ciphertext integrity;
- `metadata.json`;
- schema version;
- file checksums;
- valid `state.json`;
- server config rendering.

Restore does not apply runtime automatically. After restore, explicitly restart tunnels, repair managed firewall rules, and check the system:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tunnel restart
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge firewall repair
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

## Firewall Check / Repair

`doctor` reports missing or duplicate managed firewall rules. To check manually:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge firewall check
```

To restore managed rules:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge firewall repair
```

Repair only reconciles expected awg-forge rules for enabled tunnels:

- `nat POSTROUTING MASQUERADE` for the tunnel subnet;
- `INPUT udp --dport <port> ACCEPT`;
- stateful forwarding from the tunnel subnet through its selected WAN or WARP egress;
- return forwarding from that egress to the tunnel subnet only for `ESTABLISHED,RELATED` connections.

Every current managed rule is tagged with an `awg-forge-<tunnel-id>-...` comment. Repair removes duplicates only for those tagged rules and adds missing rules; it does not touch unrelated firewall rules. Disabled tunnels do not receive new rules.

On apply after an upgrade, AWG-Forge installs the scoped rules, then removes exact older broad `FORWARD -i/-o <interface> ACCEPT` rules for that tunnel. It recognizes its own legacy runtime directives and any matching residual host rules; unrelated firewall rules are not removed. Routing to private networks reachable through the selected egress remains an operator firewall and routing decision.

When `APPLY_CONFIG=false`, `firewall check/repair` does not change anything and reports a warning.

In the UI, run `Maintenance` -> `Doctor`. When Doctor reports a repairable managed-firewall issue and `APPLY_CONFIG=true`, it offers `Repair firewall` in the diagnostic result.

## Client Status In UI

The client list shows basic runtime status without a separate diagnostics dialog:

- `active now`: the client had a recent handshake;
- `seen recently`: the client connected before, but may not be active now;
- `never seen`: no handshake has been observed yet;
- `last seen`, `received`, and `sent`: latest handshake time and runtime counters from the server side.

For deeper diagnostics, use `Maintenance` -> `Doctor`, `Support bundle`, and the CLI commands below.

## Check IPv4 Egress

After importing a client config:

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.co
```

The response should show the server egress IP.

## No Internet Through VPN

Check the egress interface:

```bash
ip route get 1.1.1.1
```

If the output includes `dev ens3`, use:

```env
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE=ens3
```

Then:

- run `docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor`;
- check IPv4 forwarding;
- check host firewall/UFW;
- in bridge mode, check that the tunnel UDP port is published;
- issue a fresh client config from `Config` if tunnel settings or protocol params changed.

If `doctor` reports:

```text
runtime <tunnel>/awg: <interface> link exists, but awg cannot access it: Protocol not supported
```

the Linux interface exists, but the AmneziaWG runtime cannot read it as an AWG interface. This usually means a stale or broken runtime link after a failed apply, tool version change, or manual runtime experiment. Restart the tunnel from the UI or CLI:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tunnel restart
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

If restart does not help, remove the stale link in the host/container network namespace and apply the tunnel again. With host networking this is usually:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge ip link delete <interface>
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge tunnel restart
```

If `doctor` reports an `external route` mismatch, NAT may be configured for the wrong interface. Check `ip route get 1.1.1.1` and update `EXTERNAL_INTERFACE`.

If `rp_filter` is in strict mode (`1`), reverse path filtering may drop VPN traffic on hosts with non-standard routing or additional firewall/router rules. In a simple host-networking setup it is rarely the first cause, but the WARN is useful on more complex networks.

If the client row shows `received` increasing while `sent` stays at `0 B`, and counters in:

```bash
docker exec awg-forge iptables -L FORWARD -v -n
docker exec awg-forge iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v -n
```

do not increase for the tunnel subnet/interface, traffic did not reach the forwarding/NAT layer. Check the Doctor peer/handshake results, stale links, fresh client config, and the correct protocol profile.

## UI Unavailable

Check:

- SSH tunnel;
- `WEBUI_HOST=127.0.0.1`;
- `WEBUI_PORT=51821`;
- `docker compose logs -f`.

## TUN Unavailable

Check that the host has:

```bash
ls -l /dev/net/tun
```

Compose should include:

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
```

## iptables backend

Doctor expects the `nf_tables` backend:

```bash
iptables -V
```

The output should include `nf_tables`.

## Port Already In Use

If a UDP port is already in use:

- choose another tunnel port;
- or stop the process/interface currently listening on that port.
