# Quick Install

`install.sh` is an interactive installer for a fresh Linux/VPS server. It creates runtime `.env`, prepares `data/`, initializes the first tunnel into `state.json`, starts Docker Compose, and prints the next steps.

Install [Docker Engine from the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) first. If Docker or Docker Compose is unavailable, the installer exits before creating `/opt/awg-forge` or any project files.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The `master` URL provides the current stable installer. Unreleased changes are accumulated in `develop`; use an explicit test image when testing them. Downloading the script first is recommended for interactive installs. In some `curl | sudo bash` TTY/sudo environments the prompt can appear stuck because the script body and interactive answers use different input streams.

To test a non-release image, pass `IMAGE`:

```bash
sudo IMAGE=ghcr.io/astronaut808/awg-forge:test ./install.sh
```

By default, it installs into:

```text
/opt/awg-forge
```

You can choose a custom path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo AWG_FORGE_HOME=/srv/awg-forge ./install.sh
```

If the repository is already cloned, you can run the local file:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## What It Does

- checks Linux, Docker, Docker Compose, and `/dev/net/tun`;
- detects an existing install on repeated runs and offers reconfigure or full reinstall;
- offers to remove old AWG-like runtime interfaces, such as `awg0`, `awg0-1`, `awg15`, or `awg20`;
- detects the external interface with `ip route get 1.1.1.1`;
- on fresh installs, suggests the first tunnel endpoint host from the detected source IP, while allowing a custom domain;
- on fresh installs, asks for the protocol profile first, then offers automatic free UDP port selection from `30000-49999` or manual input;
- defaults the first tunnel profile to AmneziaWG 2.0 when you press Enter;
- generates `PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET`;
- creates runtime `.env` with `0600` permissions;
- enables SQLite and applies its initial schema before the service starts;
- creates `data/` with `0700` permissions;
- before starting the service, runs a one-shot `docker run ... init` command that creates `data/state.json` with the first tunnel;
- creates `docker-compose.yml` if it does not exist;
- uses the host networking Compose file;
- runs `docker compose up -d`;
- runs `docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor`;
- prints the password, `.env` path, and SSH tunnel command.

If `.env` already exists, the installer creates a backup:

```text
.env.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

## Repeated Runs and Full Reinstall

If the working directory already contains `.env`, `data/`, or `docker-compose.yml`, the installer asks what to do:

```text
1) Reconfigure existing install, keep data and backup .env
2) Full reinstall, backup and remove old data/config first
3) Upgrade image, keep data and run required database migrations
4) Abort
```

`Reconfigure` keeps `data/`, backs up the old `.env`, updates only the runtime values selected by the installer, and recreates the container. Existing operational settings such as SQLite, TLS, and trusted-proxy configuration remain unchanged. Existing tunnels remain in `data/state.json` and are not rebuilt from `.env`.

`Full reinstall` first saves the current files into a directory like:

```text
reinstall-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
```

It then stops the container, removes managed firewall rules, AWG runtime interfaces, `.env`, `data/`, and `docker-compose.yml`, and continues as a fresh install.

Important: after a full reinstall, old client configs no longer match the server because state, keys, and tunnel parameters are recreated. Issue fresh `.conf` files to clients.

## Upgrade

For a managed installation using the standard `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `./data` layout, update with:

```bash
sudo docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo AWG_FORGE_HOME=/opt/awg-forge ./install.sh upgrade
sudo docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

The first command shows the pre-upgrade state; the last checks it afterwards. Use the installer from the current release so its compatibility checks and migrations match that release. The script pulls the target image, stops the current container, backs up `.env` and `data/`, applies SQLite migrations before the new container starts, then checks that the container is running and verifies `db status`. It also prints Doctor output for review. If SQLite is currently off, it asks whether to enable it; the default is `No`. If SQLite is enabled but its database file is missing, it requires confirmation before creating a new empty database. A failed migration, failed container start, or failed database status check restores the backup and the previous image.

Set `AWG_FORGE_HOME` for another installation directory: `sudo AWG_FORGE_HOME=/srv/awg-forge ./install.sh upgrade`. When `./install.sh` runs from an existing managed installation directory, it also offers this upgrade path in its action menu. Custom Compose files, `CONFIG_DIR`, or database paths outside `./data` require a manual upgrade so the operator can back up the correct volumes.

## Old Tunnel Variables In `.env`

Older awg-forge versions stored first-tunnel fields in `.env`, such as `SERVER_HOST`, `LISTEN_PORT`, `IPV4_SUBNET`, `DNS`, `ALLOWED_IPS`, `PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE`, `MTU`, and `PROTOCOL_PROFILE`.

Current versions use `.env` only for runtime settings after `state.json` exists. If Doctor warns about legacy tunnel env variables, verify tunnel settings in the Web UI and then remove those old lines from `.env`.

## Security

By default, the Web UI binds to `127.0.0.1`, and access goes through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 51821:127.0.0.1:51821 user@server
```

If you choose `WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0` or `::`, the script shows a warning and requires explicit confirmation. Use public binds only behind a firewall, VPN, or reverse proxy.

For a fresh installation, the script also offers an ACME certificate for a public DNS domain or a short-lived public IP certificate. Select either only after TCP/80 is reachable from the Internet. The panel continues on the chosen Web UI port. The installer does not wait for the CA: an IP certificate starts its first issuance attempt after the listeners are ready, while a domain certificate is requested by the first HTTPS request for the configured name. Doctor and `tls status` report pending and retry state; see [TLS configuration](configuration.md#web-ui-tls) for constraints and recovery.

The password is shown at the end and stored in `/opt/awg-forge/.env`, or in `.env` inside `AWG_FORGE_HOME`:

```env
PASSWORD=...
```

## After Install

Open the UI, create a client, open `Config`, and use one of the offered import methods. AWG 3.x supports `.conf`, AmneziaWG QR, AmneziaVPN QR, and `vpn://`; use AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5+ and keep `.conf` as the fallback. Then check IPv4 egress:

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.co
```

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
docker exec awg-forge awg-forge doctor
```

## Uninstall

If you need to remove awg-forge, run uninstall while `data/state.json` still exists. This lets the script remove exact managed tunnel interfaces, firewall rules (current tagged scoped rules and legacy untagged rules), and WARP policy routes when applicable.

Always run the current `uninstall.sh` from `master` before removal. It contains cleanup logic for current and legacy installations.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
```

Remove the container, runtime interfaces, firewall rules, and local install files:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash -s -- --purge
```

Preview all actions without stopping the container or modifying the host:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash -s -- --dry-run --yes
```

By default, the script removes only interfaces and firewall rules that can be matched to tunnels in `data/state.json`. If state is already missing, unknown `awg*` interfaces are preserved to avoid deleting an unrelated AmneziaWG tunnel.

`--yes` confirms the runtime cleanup without prompts and keeps `data/`, `.env`, and `docker-compose.yml`. Add `--purge` only when those local installation files must also be removed.

After reviewing those interfaces, remove them explicitly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronaut808/awg-forge/master/uninstall.sh | sudo bash -s -- --remove-orphans
```
