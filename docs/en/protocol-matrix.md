# Protocol Matrix

awg-forge is a launcher and manager for existing AmneziaWG implementations. It does not implement a VPN protocol itself. The Go code renders config files and asks upstream `awg`, `awg-quick`, and `amneziawg-go`/AmneziaWG tools to run them.

## Implemented

| Profile | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `awg_legacy_1_0` | Implemented | Renders AmneziaWG Legacy / 1.0 config fields: `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`, `S1`, `S2`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`. Defaults are generated for obfuscation, not WireGuard fallback. |
| `awg_1_5` | Implemented | Adds `I1-I5` signature/masking packets to client configs. Defaults include the official DNS-like `I1` conversion packet plus small generated runtime-random signature packets for `I2-I5`. |
| `awg_2_0` | Implemented | Uses `I1-I5`, adds `S3` and `S4`, supports `H1-H4` ranges, validates non-overlapping header ranges, and renders fresh tunnel/client configs. Defaults use a generated QUIC Initial-like `I1` CPS signature. `.conf` import has been validated on desktop and iOS clients with compatible AmneziaVPN builds. |
| `awg_3` | Experimental | One AWG 3.x family profile included in the standard image and marked experimental in the Web UI. It uses pinned `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260828 and `amneziawg-tools` 3.1.20260812 userspace sources and renders `HeaderProtectionKey`, AWG3 ranges, `RandomTrailers`, and `DisableCookies`. Downloaded `.conf` and its raw AmneziaWG QR are supported; AmneziaVPN QR, `vpn://`, kernel runtime, and production compatibility are intentionally not supported. |

## Planned, Not Implemented

| Profile | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `custom` | Planned | Reserved for explicit user-provided config parameters after validation rules are clear. |

## AWG 3.x Experimental Boundaries

The single AWG 3.x experimental profile is derived from the current AmneziaVPN self-hosted generator and the pinned `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260828 / `amneziawg-tools` 3.1.20260812 release revisions. It uses:

- `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`, `S1-S4`, `H1-H4`, `I1-I5`;
- `HeaderProtectionKey` generated once per tunnel and kept out of the public API;
- `ContentPaddingAddition`, `RekeyAfterTime`, `RekeyTimeout`, `RejectAfterTime`, `KeepaliveTimeout`, `MaxHandshakeAttempts`, and `PersistentKeepalive` as scalar or ascending `uint16` ranges.
- `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies` as upstream `on`/`off` state values, both defaulting to `off`; server runtime configs render the explicit state, while client exports omit disabled options.

The numeric and range defaults mirror the upstream client generator. `I1` reuses AWG-Forge's generated QUIC Initial-like CPS mechanism from the 2.0 profile. Header Protection defaults to compatibility headers `H1-H4=1/2/3/4`, which disable custom message headers, and requires every `S1-S4` value to be at least `12`. The security-sensitive `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies` toggles default to `off`. If `RandomTrailers` is enabled, upstream recommends equal `S1-S4` values to reduce packet misclassification risk. AWG3 config parsing in the pinned tools accepts the extended ranges as `uint16`; awg-forge rejects values above `65535` rather than allowing upstream truncation.

AWG3 is forced through the pinned userspace runtime. The complete profile is experimental and must be enabled and used at the operator's own risk. Keep `RandomTrailers` off while the upstream transport-classification and first-packet issues remain unresolved. `DisableCookies=on` suppresses outgoing Cookie Reply messages, but does not disable incoming cookie handling or the rest of WireGuard's cookie logic; it still weakens handshake-flood protection and must remain off outside controlled testing. Server configs retain explicit `off` values because runtime updates use `syncconf`; downloaded client configs omit disabled options, matching AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5 canonical export. Use AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5+ for interoperability tests and do not use 5.0.0.5 for AWG 3.1. The AmneziaWG QR contains the same verified raw `.conf` as the download. Do not enable AmneziaVPN QR, native JSON, or `vpn://` imports until those formats have been validated independently.

An explicit tunnel MTU is rendered identically in server and client `.conf` files. Use `1280` as a conservative AWG 3.x fallback when the path MTU is unknown, and verify the effective value on both ends because an open AmneziaVPN import bug can replace the supplied value with a platform default.

Manual end-to-end validation of the standard image has confirmed `.conf` import, handshake, traffic, restart recovery, WAN egress, and WARP egress with compatible current AmneziaVPN, AmneziaWG, and DefaultVPN clients. This is a bounded acceptance result, not a guarantee for every platform, client build, network, or future 3.x runtime.

## Source Findings For AWG 2.0

Official Amnezia docs say AmneziaWG 2.0 is supported by AmneziaVPN app version `4.8.12.9` and later. Existing AmneziaWG 1.0 installations are shown as Legacy, and moving to 2.0 requires new guest configuration files/keys; it is not an in-place upgrade.

Official Amnezia docs describe 2.0 changes versus 1.5:

- adds `S3` and `S4`;
- adds range support for `H1-H4`;
- `H1-H4` ranges must not overlap;
- removes older `j1-j3` and `itime`;
- keeps `I1-I5`, introduced by 1.5.

Official 2.0 parameter ranges:

| Parameter | Range / syntax | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `I1-I5` | CPS signature strings | Each value is a sequence of tags such as `<b 0x...>`, `<r N>`, `<rd N>`, `<rc N>`, `<t>`. Missing values are skipped. |
| `S1-S3` | `0..64` | Fixed random prefix sizes for init, response, and cookie reply packets. |
| `S4` | `0..32` | Fixed random prefix size for transport data packets. |
| `Jc` | `0..10` in official docs | Number of junk packets after `I1-I5`. `amneziawg-go` README still says recommended `4..12`, so awg-forge should stay inside `0..10` for compatibility with the docs and AmneziaVPN UI. |
| `Jmin`, `Jmax` | `64..1024`, with `Jmin <= Jmax` | Junk packet size range. Keep `Jmax` below the effective system MTU to avoid fragmentation. |
| `H1-H4` | single `uint32` value or range `x-y` | 2.0 should use ranges by default. Ranges must not overlap. |

The `amneziawg-go` README confirms the config syntax for header ranges: either a single value like `1234` or a range like `123-456`. It also says unspecified parameters are treated as zero.

Amnezia client `dev` maps config keys directly to INI names:

- `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`;
- `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`;
- `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`;
- `I1`, `I2`, `I3`, `I4`, `I5`;
- `protocol_version` in imported native JSON, with AWG 2.0 represented as `"2"`.

The current Amnezia client import path detects AWG 2.0 when a WireGuard/AWG config has all required Legacy fields plus both `S3` and `S4`. It detects AWG 1.5 when it has Legacy fields plus at least one `I1-I5`, but no `S3/S4`.

## Rendering Rules By Profile

| Field | Legacy / 1.0 | AWG 1.5 | AWG 2.0 | AWG 3.x |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Jc/Jmin/Jmax` | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface |
| `S1/S2` | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface |
| `S3/S4` | Not rendered | Not rendered | Client and server interface | Client and server interface |
| `H1-H4` | Single values | Single values | Ranges by default, single values allowed only for explicit custom params | Client and server interface |
| `I1-I5` | Not rendered by awg-forge Legacy profile | Client interface only in current 1.5-oriented profile | Client and server interface | Client and server interface; generated `I1` uses the shared QUIC Initial-like mechanism |
| `HeaderProtectionKey` | Not rendered | Not rendered | Not rendered | Client and server interface; generated once per tunnel |
| AWG 3.x timing ranges | Not rendered | Not rendered | Not rendered | Client and server interface |
| `RandomTrailers/DisableCookies` | Not rendered | Not rendered | Not rendered | Explicit state in server runtime config; enabled values only in client exports |
| `protocol_version` | Not an INI field | Not an INI field | Not an INI field; only AmneziaVPN JSON import metadata should use `"2"` | Not an INI field |

## Current Defaults

`awg-forge` generates non-zero obfuscation defaults:

| Parameter | Legacy / 1.0 and 1.5 generated default |
| --- | --- |
| `Jc` | random `4..10` |
| `Jmin` | random `64..256` |
| `Jmax` | random `768..1024`, always greater than `Jmin` |
| `S1` | random `15..64` |
| `S2` | random `15..64`, avoiding `S1 + 56 == S2` |
| `H1-H4` | crypto-random unique non-zero single values, generated without modulo reduction |

For AWG 2.0, defaults are:

- `Jc`: random `4..10`;
- `Jmin`: random `64..256`;
- `Jmax`: random `768..1024`;
- `S1-S3`: random `15..64`;
- `S4`: random `8..32`;
- `H1-H4`: crypto-random non-overlapping ranges with width `30000..65535`, not single values;
- `I1`: generated per tunnel as a `1200..1232` byte QUIC Initial-like CPS packet, with a randomized protected first byte, QUIC v1 marker, one of several destination/source connection ID profiles, a valid QUIC varint length field, and runtime-random protected payload bytes split into parser-safe randomized `<r ...>` chunks of at most `999` bytes;
- `I2-I5`: the same small CPS entropy chain currently used by the 1.5 profile.

For the experimental AWG 3.x profile, defaults are:

- `Jc`: random `4..6`; `Jmin`: `10`; `Jmax`: `50`;
- `S1/S2`: distinct random values in `12..149`; `S3`: random `12..63`; `S4`: `12`;
- `H1-H4`: distinct values `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, protected by a per-tunnel `HeaderProtectionKey`;
- `I1`: the same generated `1200..1232` byte QUIC Initial-like CPS packet as AWG 2.0; `I2-I5` are empty;
- timing and padding ranges: `10-100`, `100-120`, `3-7`, `150-180`, `5-15`, and `15-20`; `PersistentKeepalive`: `25-35`;
- `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies`: `off`.

Zero-valued obfuscation parameters are treated as weak defaults because Amnezia docs note that all-zero behavior falls back toward standard WireGuard behavior.

AWG 2.0 uses a randomized QUIC Initial-like `I1` signature by default. Only the UDP payload shape is modeled: Ethernet/IP/UDP headers from packet captures are not included. The generated packet is intended for AmneziaWG CPS masking, not for establishing a real QUIC session. Its size is randomized within `1200..1232` bytes, and large random sections are split into randomized CPS `<r ...>` chunks below the parser boundary.

## Validation Status For AWG 2.0

Validated:

- generated `.conf` imported and connected on a desktop client;
- generated `.conf` imported and connected on iOS after updating to a compatible AmneziaVPN build;
- AmneziaVPN-compatible QR export is implemented as structured JSON with `last_config`, zlib/qCompress-style wrapping, base64url payload, and compatibility-critical JSON field types;
- Docker/server-side `awg show` reports 2.0 params, handshake, and traffic for `awg20`.

Still requires broader validation:

- QR import behavior across AmneziaVPN iOS, Android, and Desktop builds;
- exact native import schema differences across AmneziaVPN platforms.
