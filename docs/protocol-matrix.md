# Protocol Matrix

awg-forge is a launcher and manager for existing AmneziaWG implementations. It does not implement a VPN protocol itself. The Go code renders config files and asks upstream `awg`, `awg-quick`, and `amneziawg-go`/AmneziaWG tools to run them.

## Implemented

| Profile | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `awg_legacy_1_0` | Implemented | Renders AmneziaWG Legacy / 1.0 config fields: `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`, `S1`, `S2`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`. Defaults are generated for obfuscation, not WireGuard fallback. |
| `awg_1_5` | Implemented | Adds `I1-I5` signature/masking packets to client configs. Defaults include the official DNS-like `I1` conversion packet plus small generated runtime-random signature packets for `I2-I5`. |
| `awg_2_0` | Implemented | Uses `I1-I5`, adds `S3` and `S4`, supports `H1-H4` ranges, validates non-overlapping header ranges, and renders fresh tunnel/client configs. Defaults use a generated QUIC Initial-like `I1` CPS signature. `.conf` import has been validated on desktop and iOS clients with compatible AmneziaVPN builds. |
| `awg_3_0` | Laboratory only | Available only in the locally built AWG3 lab image with explicit opt-in. It uses pinned `amneziawg-go` userspace and renders the current self-hosted `.conf` field set, including `HeaderProtectionKey` and AWG3 ranges. QR, `vpn://`, kernel-module runtime, and production compatibility are intentionally not supported. |

## Planned, Not Implemented

| Profile | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `custom` | Planned | Reserved for explicit user-provided config parameters after validation rules are clear. |

## AWG 3.0 Laboratory Boundaries

The AWG 3.0 laboratory profile is derived from the current AmneziaVPN self-hosted generator and the pinned `amneziawg-go` / `amneziawg-tools` source revisions. It uses:

- `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`, `S1-S4`, `H1-H4`, `I1-I5`;
- `HeaderProtectionKey` generated once per tunnel and kept out of the public API;
- `ContentPaddingAddition`, `RekeyAfterTime`, `RekeyTimeout`, `RejectAfterTime`, `KeepaliveTimeout`, `MaxHandshakeAttempts`, and `PersistentKeepalive` as scalar or ascending `uint16` ranges.

The default values mirror the upstream client generator. AWG3 config parsing in the pinned tools accepts the extended ranges as `uint16`; awg-forge rejects values above `65535` rather than allowing upstream truncation. `S1-S4` must be at least `12` when header protection is enabled.

AWG3 is forced through the pinned userspace runtime. Do not use it with the kernel module, do not assume compatibility with every client build, and do not enable QR or native JSON imports until those formats have been validated independently.

## Source Findings For AWG 2.0

Official Amnezia docs say AmneziaWG 2.0 is supported by AmneziaVPN app version `4.8.12.9` and later. Existing AmneziaWG 1.0 installations are shown as Legacy, and moving to 2.0 requires new guest configuration files/keys; it is not an in-place upgrade.

Official Amnezia docs describe 2.0 changes versus 1.5:

- adds `S3` and `S4`;
- adds range support for `H1-H4`;
- `H1-H4` ranges must not overlap;
- removes older `j1-j3` and `itime`;
- keeps `I1-I5`, introduced by 1.5.

Official 2.0 parameter ranges:

| Parameter | Range / syntax | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `I1-I5` | CPS signature strings | Each value is a sequence of tags such as `<b 0x...>`, `<r N>`, `<rd N>`, `<rc N>`, `<t>`. Missing values are skipped. |
| `S1-S3` | `0..64` | Fixed random prefix sizes for init, response, and cookie reply packets. |
| `S4` | `0..32` | Fixed random prefix size for transport data packets. |
| `Jc` | `0..10` in official docs | Number of junk packets after `I1-I5`. `amneziawg-go` README still says recommended `4..12`, so awg-forge should stay inside `0..10` for compatibility with the docs and AmneziaVPN UI. |
| `Jmin`, `Jmax` | `64..1024`, with `Jmin <= Jmax` | Junk packet size range. Keep `Jmax` below the effective system MTU to avoid fragmentation. |
| `H1-H4` | single `uint32` value or range `x-y` | 2.0 should use ranges by default. Ranges must not overlap. |

The `amneziawg-go` README confirms the config syntax for header ranges: either a single value like `1234` or a range like `123-456`. It also says unspecified parameters are treated as zero.

Amnezia client `dev` maps config keys directly to INI names:

- `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`;
- `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`;
- `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`;
- `I1`, `I2`, `I3`, `I4`, `I5`;
- `protocol_version` in imported native JSON, with AWG 2.0 represented as `"2"`.

The current Amnezia client import path detects AWG 2.0 when a WireGuard/AWG config has all required Legacy fields plus both `S3` and `S4`. It detects AWG 1.5 when it has Legacy fields plus at least one `I1-I5`, but no `S3/S4`.

## Rendering Rules By Profile

| Field | Legacy / 1.0 | AWG 1.5 | AWG 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Jc/Jmin/Jmax` | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface |
| `S1/S2` | Client and server interface | Client and server interface | Client and server interface |
| `S3/S4` | Not rendered | Not rendered | Client and server interface |
| `H1-H4` | Single values | Single values | Ranges by default, single values allowed only for explicit custom params |
| `I1-I5` | Not rendered by awg-forge Legacy profile | Client interface only in current 1.5-oriented profile | Client and server interface by default, because 2.0 server settings are inherited by generated configs |
| `protocol_version` | Not an INI field | Not an INI field | Not an INI field; only AmneziaVPN JSON import metadata should use `"2"` |

## Current Defaults

`awg-forge` generates non-zero obfuscation defaults:

| Parameter | Legacy / 1.0 and 1.5 generated default |
| --- | --- |
| `Jc` | random `4..10` |
| `Jmin` | random `64..256` |
| `Jmax` | random `768..1024`, always greater than `Jmin` |
| `S1` | random `15..64` |
| `S2` | random `15..64`, avoiding `S1 + 56 == S2` |
| `H1-H4` | crypto-random unique non-zero single values, generated without modulo reduction |

For AWG 2.0, defaults are:

- `Jc`: random `4..10`;
- `Jmin`: random `64..256`;
- `Jmax`: random `768..1024`;
- `S1-S3`: random `15..64`;
- `S4`: random `8..32`;
- `H1-H4`: crypto-random non-overlapping ranges with width `30000..65535`, not single values;
- `I1`: generated per tunnel as a `1200..1232` byte QUIC Initial-like CPS packet, with a randomized protected first byte, QUIC v1 marker, one of several destination/source connection ID profiles, a valid QUIC varint length field, and runtime-random protected payload bytes split into parser-safe randomized `<r ...>` chunks of at most `999` bytes;
- `I2-I5`: the same small CPS entropy chain currently used by the 1.5 profile.

Zero-valued obfuscation parameters are treated as weak defaults because Amnezia docs note that all-zero behavior falls back toward standard WireGuard behavior.

AWG 2.0 uses a randomized QUIC Initial-like `I1` signature by default. Only the UDP payload shape is modeled: Ethernet/IP/UDP headers from packet captures are not included. The generated packet is intended for AmneziaWG CPS masking, not for establishing a real QUIC session. Its size is randomized within `1200..1232` bytes, and large random sections are split into randomized CPS `<r ...>` chunks below the parser boundary.

## Validation Status For AWG 2.0

Validated:

- generated `.conf` imported and connected on a desktop client;
- generated `.conf` imported and connected on iOS after updating to a compatible AmneziaVPN build;
- AmneziaVPN-compatible QR export is implemented as structured JSON with `last_config`, zlib/qCompress-style wrapping, base64url payload, and compatibility-critical JSON field types;
- Docker/server-side `awg show` reports 2.0 params, handshake, and traffic for `awg20`.

Still requires broader validation:

- QR import behavior across AmneziaVPN iOS, Android, and Desktop builds;
- exact native import schema differences across AmneziaVPN platforms.
