# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added an OpenAPI 3.1 browser control API contract for the stable tunnel, client, traffic-limit, and WARP control surface, with compatibility tests for the contract envelope.
- Added one experimental AWG 3.x profile to the standard image with pinned `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260828 and `amneziawg-tools` 3.1.20260812 userspace sources, validated `.conf` interoperability through compatible clients over WAN and WARP, and guarded `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies` controls that default to `off`. AWG 2.0 remains the default profile.
- Added AWG 3.x client export through raw `.conf` QR for AmneziaWG, typed structured QR for AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5+, and the existing `vpn://` raw-config import format, while retaining `.conf` download as the stable fallback.

### Changed

- Publish GitHub Releases automatically from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section when a version tag is pushed.
- AWG 3.x client `.conf` exports now omit disabled `RandomTrailers` and `DisableCookies` options for AmneziaVPN 5.0.1.5+ compatibility, while server runtime configs retain explicit `off` values for reliable live resets.
- Unified AmneziaWG runtime refs and Docker packaging so the standard image exposes AWG 3.x without a separate lab image, Compose override, or environment flag; the complete profile remains explicitly marked as experimental and use-at-your-own-risk in the Web UI.
- Reused the existing generated QUIC Initial-like `I1` default for AWG 3.x instead of maintaining a separate signature default.
- Simplified tunnel cards by removing repeated interface/profile labels, and made client state colors unambiguous: green for online, blue for enabled, and gray for disabled or expired.
- Hide empty protocol filters on the tunnel dashboard while keeping every supported profile available when creating a tunnel, and expose the established client export paths consistently for AWG 3.x.
- Updated the pinned AWG 3.x userspace runtime to `amneziawg-go` 3.1.20260828 for current upstream UDP-window padding and `DisableCookies` under-load fixes; unresolved `RandomTrailers` classification issues remain guarded by the experimental status and an `off` default.
- New AWG 3.x tunnels now use an explicit `1280` MTU fallback when no MTU is configured, keeping server and exported client configurations aligned while current AmneziaVPN import fixes remain pending. Explicit values and existing tunnel state are preserved.

### Fixed

- Reconcile WARP once after all tunnel interfaces are restored during startup, and report WARP apply failures on WARP instead of leaving a stale error on an otherwise healthy tunnel.
- Show form submission failures inside the active dialog instead of behind the modal layer.

### Security

- Added pull-request security and race checks for reachable Go vulnerabilities in AWG-Forge and the pinned `amneziawg-go` daemon, secret scanning, focused Semgrep rules, shell/Docker/workflow linting, GitHub Actions security analysis, and data races; Docker validation now smoke-tests the built image and blocks fixed HIGH/CRITICAL operating-system vulnerabilities while reporting application dependency findings for reachability triage.
- Added stable safe API error codes and bound idempotency keys to request bodies, preventing a reused key from replaying a different mutation.
- Updated the Go build toolchain to `1.26.7` and the frontend lockfile to `nanoid` `3.3.18` to include current security fixes.
- Removed raw `awg show` output from support bundles and the Support UI because AWG 3.x exposes `HeaderProtectionKey`; AWG 3.x protocol secrets are also covered by defense-in-depth text redaction.

## v0.18.0 - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Added managed ACME HTTP-01 certificates for a public domain through `awg-forge tls use acme-domain`, including automatic renewal and persisted certificate cache.
- Added managed ACME HTTP-01 certificates for a public IPv4 or IPv6 address through `awg-forge tls use acme-ip`; the short-lived certificate is renewed by the running service before expiry.
- Added `awg-forge tls use reverse-proxy` for deployments where a trusted reverse proxy terminates TLS.

### Changed

- Made `CONFIG_DIR/tls/config.json` the sole desired TLS configuration source; `.env` now contains only deployment context such as bind address, session-cookie policy, and trusted-proxy settings.
- Added TLS configuration and ACME certificate state to encrypted backup validation without including private key material in support output.
- Updated installation, configuration, diagnostics, and security documentation for managed ACME, reverse proxy, TLS recovery, and public/loopback binding workflows.
- Publish Docker images for pushes to `develop` as `ghcr.io/astronaut808/awg-forge:develop` in addition to immutable commit tags.
- Scope local Gitleaks targets to history reachable from the current `HEAD`, so unrelated local branches do not affect security gates.
- Updated Aislop to v0.14.0 and retained its quality gate in CI with scoped exclusions for legacy file/function-size findings.

### Fixed

- Hardened the ACME HTTP fallback redirect so untrusted HTTP request targets cannot influence its HTTPS `Location` header.
- Prevented managed ACME IP renewal from retrying immediately when a CA issues a certificate whose lifetime is shorter than the renewal lead time.
- Fixed Web UI listener construction for IPv6 `WEBUI_HOST` values such as `::`.
- Show an access URL that matches the configured TLS mode after installation or reconfiguration.
- Cache client QR previews only in the active Config dialog, so switching QR import modes no longer briefly shows the previous QR.

### Security

- Hardened cached idempotent API responses to remain validated `application/json` output rather than writing cached bytes directly to the response.
- Reject TLS settings symlinks during backup creation instead of following a replaced path.
- Mark ACME IP HTTP-01 challenge responses as `nosniff` while preserving their required exact `text/plain` body.

## v0.17.0 - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Added structured, redacted runtime JSON logs for Docker with configurable `LOG_LEVEL`, request correlation IDs, and bounded retention for new managed Compose installations.
- Added safe automatic UDP port selection for new tunnels, with a configurable `30000-49999` default range, bridge-mode intersection with published ports, and preserved manual selection.
- Added optional per-client rolling 30-day traffic quotas with UTC-day aggregation and safe automatic re-enable only for clients previously disabled by that quota, while preserving existing lifetime traffic limits.
- Added `install.sh upgrade` for managed installations: backup, optional SQLite activation, schema migration before the new container starts, post-update checks, and rollback on migration or startup failure.

### Changed

- Scoped managed forwarding to each tunnel subnet and selected egress, added tagged rule ownership, and added safe migration from legacy broad forwarding rules during apply and uninstall.
- Streamlined Maintenance Center around operator tasks: contextual firewall repair in Doctor, combined backup/restore, CLI-only upstream update checks, and safe runtime metadata in Support.
- Improved Doctor database migration guidance for Docker and skipped traffic-limit diagnostics until a required migration completes.
- Require an exact tunnel-name confirmation before deleting a tunnel that has clients with a recorded connection.
- Updated the Go runtime to `1.26.5` and refreshed the SQLite driver dependency graph.
- Updated the pinned `amneziawg-go` build reference to `c1e9bb3758e7` for the upstream Outline SDK module-path migration.
- Fresh installer and `.env.example` now enable SQLite by default; existing installations remain unchanged unless SQLite is explicitly enabled during upgrade.
- Reconfigure now preserves existing operational `.env` settings such as SQLite, TLS, and trusted-proxy configuration.
- Hardened `uninstall.sh` for non-interactive use: it safely parses nested tunnel state, supports `curl | bash`, and keeps local data unless `--purge` is explicitly requested.

## v0.16.0 - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added Web UI TLS foundation: `off`, `reverse-proxy`, and validated `manual` modes; trusted-proxy CIDRs; graceful HTTP shutdown; Doctor and CLI TLS status/configuration.
- Added SQLite-backed traffic history collection with daily client aggregates, per-client total traffic in client rows, and aggregate Maintenance traffic totals.
- Added traffic quotas with SQLite-stored per-client limits, Web UI limit editing, API/state exposure, and automatic client disablement when recorded traffic reaches the configured limit.

### Fixed

- Hardened Maintenance log polling and tunnel egress mode rendering to cover the UI behavior reported in [#41](https://github.com/astronaut808/AWG-Forge/issues/41).
- Improved Web UI session-expiry handling so an expired session closes stale modals, clears the cached dashboard state, and returns to login.
- Explained failed HTTP logins caused by rejected Secure session cookies and linked to TLS configuration ([#45](https://github.com/astronaut808/AWG-Forge/issues/45)).
- Blocked Web/API/CLI client re-enable attempts when the recorded traffic limit is still exceeded, avoiding misleading enabled-state results.

### Changed

- Documented factual diagnostics for UDP reachability, handshake, egress, and WARP routing.
- Added an Aislop project config and CI quality gate that exclude generated Web UI assets and locale dictionaries from Aislop-only noise while keeping source quality warnings visible.
- Grouped Doctor output by diagnostic category in CLI, Web UI, and support bundles without changing the underlying checks.
- Added Doctor warnings for clients whose recorded SQLite traffic exceeds their configured traffic limit.
- Added traffic-limit selection during client creation and MiB/GiB/TiB units in client traffic-limit forms.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Added the optional SQLite database foundation with embedded migrations, `awg-forge db status|migrate`, and Doctor integration when `DATABASE_MODE=sqlite`.
- Added SQLite-backed audit dual-write and merged SQLite/JSONL audit reads so JSONL remains the reliable local audit trail while SQLite provides an indexed copy.
- Added `awg-forge db retention apply` for bounded SQLite operational history cleanup.
- Added database status metadata to support bundles without dumping database table rows.
- Added database environment configuration for future operational history storage while keeping `DATABASE_MODE=off` as the default.

## v0.14.1 - 2026-07-04

### Security

- Hardened GitHub Actions supply-chain safety by pinning workflow actions to immutable commit SHAs.
- Added a Dependabot update cooldown for Go modules and GitHub Actions dependencies.
- Added local security scan targets for `gitleaks`, `trivy`, and Semgrep, with generated Web UI assets excluded from source scanning.

### Changed

- Narrowed internal runtime command helpers to explicit allowed commands and documented accepted Semgrep risks for dynamic session cookie security, deployment-level TLS, and raw JSON/download/SSE responses.

## v0.14.0 - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added a RU/EN language switch in the Web UI, with locale persistence in the browser and localized dashboard, dialogs, maintenance actions, and import flows.

## v0.13.0 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added a unified client `Config` dialog with separate AmneziaVPN QR, AmneziaWG `.conf` QR, `.conf` download, and `vpn://` copy options.
- Added authenticated client QR codes in the Web UI, generated server-side as PNG with `no-store` caching and `.conf` download fallback.
- Added AmneziaVPN-compatible QR export using the JSON `last_config` wrapper, zlib compression, Qt/qCompress-style binary header, base64url payload, and compatibility-critical JSON types expected by AmneziaVPN.

### Changed

- Removed automatic `.conf` download after client creation; client import now requires an explicit `Config` action.
- Changed the client `Config` dialog to show one active QR mode at a time, with compact inline QR, click-to-enlarge preview, QR download, and preserved single-QR series API compatibility.

## v0.12.0 - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Changed fresh installs to keep runtime/container settings in `.env` and initialize the first tunnel directly into `state.json` with a one-shot `awg-forge init` container before `docker compose up -d`.
- Changed the quick installer default profile to AmneziaWG 2.0 when the profile prompt is accepted with Enter.
- Made existing `state.json` the source of truth for tunnel endpoint/settings on repeated installs; old tunnel variables in `.env` are now ignored after state exists.
- Removed the legacy profile dashboard switch and made the tunnel-first dashboard the only Web UI mode, with compact protocol filters and protocol-aware empty-state tunnel creation.
- Removed the redundant per-tunnel Web UI Health action; client runtime status and traffic counters are shown inline, while deeper diagnostics remain in Maintenance/Doctor.
- Changed AWG 2.0 defaults to generate a fresh `1200..1232` byte QUIC Initial-like `I1` CPS signature with multiple connection-ID profiles and documented-size random chunks instead of reusing the AWG 1.5 DNS-like signature.

### Added

- Added Doctor guidance for upgraded installs that still contain legacy tunnel variables in `.env`, with a safe cleanup note after verifying tunnel settings in the UI.
- Added regression tests for AWG 2.0 default initialization, explicit first-tunnel init options, invalid initial tunnel names, and existing-state precedence over changed env tunnel values.
- Added protocol tests for randomized AWG 2.0 QUIC-like `I1` generation, `1200..1232` byte CPS signature validation, and per-token random chunk limits.

## v0.11.0 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added a Vite + Preact + TypeScript Web UI source tree under `web/`, with generated assets embedded into the Go binary at build time.
- Added authenticated realtime dashboard updates through `/api/events`, with polling fallback when server-sent events are unavailable.
- Added a Mono-inspired UI refresh with improved light/dark themes, tighter dashboard density, restored footer links, and visible build version in the Web UI.
- Added an optional experimental tunnel-first dashboard mode that groups existing tunnels by protocol and moves protocol selection into the create-tunnel flow.
- Added client editing from the dashboard, including notes and expiration controls with quick presets and custom date/time selection.

### Changed

- Replaced the previous hand-written static frontend files with reproducible generated assets from the `web/` source tree.
- Updated CI and `make ci` to type-check, build, and lint the new frontend while keeping the production Docker runtime Node-free.
- Improved tunnel/client layout, form alignment, select styling, button states, loading indicators, and responsive behavior.
- Made Maintenance Center logs auto-refresh from newest to oldest without requiring a manual "load logs" action.
- Simplified public documentation by removing internal planning/research drafts and refreshing README screenshots for the new UI.

### Fixed

- Fixed light-theme form contrast issues in modal forms and restore verification.
- Fixed repeated parallax event listener registration after dashboard reloads/profile changes.
- Fixed WARP egress UI copy and stale-config behavior so WARP-only egress changes do not require fresh client configs.

## v0.10.0 - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added per-tunnel Cloudflare WARP egress. Each tunnel can now use either normal server WAN egress or the shared `warp0` WARP outbound interface.
- Added a Maintenance Center WARP tab for automatic registration, manual config import, restart, and deletion without exposing private keys or WARP account tokens to the UI.
- Added `Cloudflare WARP` egress selection during tunnel creation, using the existing shared `warp0` when configured or registering it automatically when needed.
- Added automatic WARP registration when a tunnel is switched to `Cloudflare WARP` egress from tunnel settings.
- Added Cloudflare WARP unregister during WARP deletion for automatically registered WARP devices.
- Added WARP-aware firewall handling, doctor checks, backup validation, and support bundle redaction.
- Added a README dashboard screenshot with synthetic demo data.
- Added client expiration presets for `1 hour`, `1 day`, `7 days`, `30 days`, plus a custom calendar/date-time option.
- Added loading indicators for long-running UI actions such as WARP registration, update checks, doctor/firewall actions, backup, restore verification, and support bundle downloads.

### Changed

- Updated pinned AmneziaWG upstream refs to `amneziawg-go` `v0.2.19` and `amneziawg-tools` `v1.0.20260618-2`.
- Refreshed the Russian and English README files to keep the project overview shorter, clearer, and easier to scan.
- Improved form control alignment for tunnel settings, restore verification, native selects, file inputs, and checkbox rows.
- Restored MTU selection in tunnel settings with `Auto`, common presets, and a custom value.
- Changed Maintenance Center audit log rendering to show newest events first while preserving backend API order.
- Removed internal planning, design, and research drafts from the public documentation tree, keeping user/operator docs and protocol reference material focused.

### Fixed

- Preserved AmneziaWG-specific WARP protocol parameters during manual WARP config import, so externally generated WARP configs can be rendered and restarted correctly.
- Kept existing client configs fresh when switching a tunnel between server WAN and WARP egress, because client-facing config content does not change for that operation.

## v0.9.1 - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed the quick installer exiting before interactive prompts on a clean server because the expected "no existing install" result was treated as fatal by `set -e`.
- Made the installer verify Docker and Docker Compose before creating the installation directory, and print the official Docker Engine installation documentation when Docker is missing.
- Added shell regression tests for clean installation and existing-install detection.
- Fixed `uninstall.sh --dry-run` potentially looping forever on existing iptables rules and executing `docker compose down` despite dry-run mode.
- Made uninstall stop the container before cleaning runtime interfaces and firewall rules.
- Made uninstall use the external interface saved in `state.json` when removing managed NAT rules.
- Prevented uninstall from deleting unknown host AWG interfaces by default; orphan interface removal now requires explicit `--remove-orphans`.

## v0.9.0 - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added a safe JSONL audit log with local rotation for operational events such as login attempts, tunnel/client changes, runtime apply failures, firewall repair, backup/support bundle creation, restore verification, and update checks.
- Added `awg-forge logs` with `--tail`, `--level`, `--event`, and `--json` filters.
- Added a Maintenance Center `Logs` tab for viewing recent audit events from the Web UI.
- Added redacted audit log excerpts to support bundles.
- Added audit log environment configuration: `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`, `AUDIT_LOG_PATH`, `AUDIT_LOG_MAX_SIZE`, and `AUDIT_LOG_MAX_FILES`.
- Added a full reinstall path to `install.sh` for repeated runs: existing installs can now be backed up, stopped, cleaned from runtime interfaces/firewall rules, and recreated from scratch.
- Added `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=auto|true|false` for explicit Web UI session cookie policy.
- Added approximate client runtime status and readable `received` / `sent` counters to the dashboard client list.
- Added persistent per-client `ever_connected` and `last_seen_at` fields, updated from runtime handshakes.
- Added client expiration with `Never`, `1 day`, `7 days`, and `30 days` presets; expired clients stay visible but are not rendered as server peers.

### Security

- Audit logging redacts secret-looking fields before writing to disk and must not store private keys, preshared keys, passwords, session secrets, full configs, import keys, or raw protocol parameter values.
- Audit log files are created with `0600` permissions and stored under the protected config directory by default.
- Full reinstall creates a local backup before removing `.env`, `data/`, and `docker-compose.yml`.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` is opt-in and reported by doctor as a warning because it allows session cookies over plain HTTP on non-loopback hosts.
- State writes now use an atomic temp-file + rename flow with `0600` permissions to reduce the chance of partial `state.json` writes.

### Fixed

- Serialized service-level state mutations so concurrent UI/API actions cannot overwrite each other or allocate duplicate client IPs.
- Made mutating operations roll back saved state, rendered configs, and runtime state consistently when render, file write, or apply fails.
- Clarified client runtime and expiration badges in the Web UI so approximate online status, saved last-seen history, stale configs, and expired/not-rendered clients are easier to understand.

## v0.8.2 - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Suggested free tunnel names, ports, and IPv4 subnets across all profiles when creating tunnels, preventing the Web UI from proposing already-used defaults such as `awg0` or `10.8.0.0/24`.
- Updated the quick installer to choose the protocol profile before tunnel defaults and to write `TUNNEL_NAME`, so first-tunnel defaults stay aligned with Legacy, AWG 1.5, or AWG 2.0.
- Extended `doctor` diagnostics for connected-but-no-internet cases with external route matching, `rp_filter`, UDP listener, runtime config validation, and clearer stale AWG link reporting for `Protocol not supported`.
- Expanded support bundles with route tables, policy rules, UDP listeners, iptables counters, and per-interface `rp_filter` output while keeping secrets redacted.

## v0.8.1 - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Split the Go application service into focused tunnel, client, runtime, initialization, backup crypto, and restore modules without changing CLI or API behavior.
- Split the static Web UI into focused dashboard, forms, Maintenance Center, shared UI helper, safe HTML renderer, and bootstrap scripts without adding a frontend build pipeline or runtime dependency.
- Removed unreachable legacy Maintenance UI code and updated English and Russian development documentation for the modular static frontend.

### Security

- Added a small defense-in-depth HTML sanitizer for dynamic Web UI fragments while keeping explicit value escaping at composition sites.
- Made attribute escaping explicit for dynamic HTML attributes.
- Hardened rendered config storage paths by validating tunnel and client path components before filesystem writes or tunnel directory removal.

## v0.8.0 - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Added Maintenance Center 2.0 with tabbed Overview, Doctor, Firewall, Backup, Restore, Updates, Support, and System sections.
- Added Web UI restore verification for encrypted `.afbackup` files as a dry-run that validates backups without writing to `CONFIG_DIR`.
- Added `/api/restore/verify` for authenticated restore dry-runs from the Web UI.
- Added tests for restore verify API success and wrong backup password handling.
- Added `golangci-lint` checks to local `make ci` and GitHub Actions.

### Changed

- Reworked Maintenance UI from separate cards into a single operations center.
- Firewall repair, backup download, support bundle download, update checks, and restore guidance are now grouped under Maintenance.
- Restore now replaces `CONFIG_DIR` contents instead of renaming the directory itself, so it works with Docker volume mounts.
- Backup/restore documentation now shows how to copy host backups into the container before running CLI restore.

### Security

- Added `Cache-Control: no-store` hardening for backup, support bundle, and restore verify responses.
- Restore verification upload is size-limited and uses a temporary file that is removed after validation.
- Limited JSON API request bodies to reduce accidental or malicious memory pressure.
- Backup restore/verify now rejects oversized encrypted backup files and unsupported KDF parameters before decryption work.
- Updated `golang.org/x/crypto` to remove known vulnerable module findings from dependency scanning.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Added an authenticated experimental `Import key` action for clients.
- Added `/api/clients/<id>/import-key`, returning a `vpn://` text key generated from the rendered client `.conf` for AmneziaVPN / DefaultVPN compatibility testing.
- Added tests for import key generation and AWG 2.0 import key API output.
- Added English and Russian AmneziaVPN import/subscription research notes.

### Changed

- Documented `.conf` download as the stable production import path and `Import key` as an experimental compatibility path.
- Updated quick install documentation to recommend downloading `install.sh` before running it with sudo for more reliable interactive prompts.

### Security

- Added `Cache-Control: no-store` hardening for rendered client `.conf` downloads and import key JSON responses.
- Import keys remain authenticated-only and contain the same client secrets as `.conf` files; they are not public subscription links.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added `awg-forge restore verify <backup.afbackup>` as a safe restore dry-run command.
- Restore verification decrypts encrypted backups, validates metadata, schema versions, file checksums, archive paths, state sanity, and server/client config rendering without writing to `CONFIG_DIR`.
- Restore verification prints a redacted backup summary with format, schema, file count, tunnel count, client count, server host, and per-tunnel profile/port/subnet information.
- Added tests for successful restore verification, wrong backup passwords, no-write dry-run behavior, and duplicated tunnel listen port detection.

### Changed

- Restore now shares the same decrypt/read/validate path as restore verification before replacing the config directory.
- Documentation now recommends running `restore verify` before `restore` in both Docker and local CLI workflows.

### Security

- Restore verification never prints private keys, preshared keys, session secrets, or rendered client configs.
- Backup validation now rejects duplicate tunnel IDs, names, interfaces, listen ports, subnets, client IDs, invalid tunnel subnets, and invalid client IP addresses before restore.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added Support bundle generation from CLI with `awg-forge support-bundle [output.zip]`.
- Added authenticated Web UI support bundle download via `/api/support-bundle`.
- Support bundles include redacted config/state summaries, Doctor results, runtime command output, and config directory file inventory without rendered config contents.
- Added tests to ensure support bundles do not leak private keys, preshared keys, passwords, or session secrets.
- Added encrypted backups with `awg-forge backup [output.afbackup]` using a separate `BACKUP_PASSWORD`.
- Added safe CLI restore with `awg-forge restore <backup.afbackup>`, password verification, schema checks, checksum checks, and a pre-restore encrypted backup.
- Added Web UI encrypted backup download with a dedicated backup password prompt.
- Added `awg-forge firewall check` and `awg-forge firewall repair` for manual runtime firewall reconciliation.
- Added Web UI firewall repair action inside the Doctor modal.
- Added shared firewall rule modeling and tests for expected rules, missing rules, duplicates, and disabled tunnel handling.
- Added Web UI Maintenance hub for Doctor, firewall repair, encrypted backups, support bundles, update checks, and CLI-only restore guidance.
- Added self-contained interactive `install.sh` quick installer for Linux/VPS Docker host-network setup.
- Added MIT license, contributing guide, security policy, and Dependabot config for public repository readiness.
- Added `uninstall.sh` to remove runtime interfaces, managed firewall rules, containers, and optionally local install files.
- Added per-tunnel `Server host` override in Web UI settings for client config endpoints.

### Changed

- Runtime tunnel apply now uses the same firewall repair logic as manual maintenance.
- Doctor firewall diagnostics now point missing and duplicate managed rules to `awg-forge firewall repair`.
- Topbar maintenance actions are grouped under `Maintenance`, and primary buttons use a calmer hover/border treatment.
- Documentation now describes Maintenance hub actions instead of the old separate topbar maintenance buttons.
- Tunnel endpoint cards now show whether the host is inherited from global `SERVER_HOST` or customized per tunnel.
- `.env.example` now includes `SESSION_SECRET` so generated installs can keep stable UI sessions explicitly.
- `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` now exclude local env files, backups, configs, and support archives.
- The quick installer now detects stale AWG-like interfaces before startup and recreates the container when applying a new `.env`.
- Changing global `SERVER_HOST` now refreshes inherited tunnel endpoints while preserving tunnels with explicit host overrides.
- Backup restore path validation is hardened against archive traversal paths.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-05-20

Runtime safety, subnet correctness, and manual AmneziaWG update checks.

### Added

- Added reproducible AmneziaWG tool pinning through `build/amneziawg.refs`.
- Added `awg-forge updates` to compare bundled AmneziaWG refs with upstream GitHub commits.
- Added Web UI `Updates` modal for checking bundled AmneziaWG component status.
- Added `/api/updates` for authenticated UI update checks.
- Added `Makefile` helpers for local and Docker workflows:
  - `make updates-local`;
  - `make updates-docker`;
  - `make update-amneziawg-refs`;
  - `make docker-build`;
  - `make ci`.
- Added `scripts/update-amneziawg-refs.sh` to update pinned AmneziaWG refs for manual PR-based upgrades.
- Added build metadata for awg-forge version, awg-forge commit, pinned `amneziawg-go`, and pinned `amneziawg-tools`.
- Added Russian and English README entrypoints, plus split Russian and English docs for setup, configuration, usage, diagnostics, updates, development, and security.
- Added tests for non-`/24` subnet allocation and rendering across Legacy / 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0.
- Added tests for apply failure rollback and stricter Origin/Host validation.

### Changed

- Docker builds now fetch pinned AmneziaWG commits instead of cloning floating upstream `HEAD`.
- Docker image labels and environment metadata now expose awg-forge and pinned AmneziaWG build refs.
- GitHub Docker workflow passes awg-forge version and commit metadata into image builds.
- Server configs now render the actual tunnel subnet prefix instead of hardcoding `/24`.
- Tunnel subnet input is normalized to canonical IPv4 CIDR form.
- Client IP allocation now works across supported IPv4 CIDR sizes, not only the last octet of `/24`.
- Supported tunnel subnet sizes are constrained to `/16` through `/30` to avoid accidental huge allocations or unusable networks.
- Apply failures for mutating operations now roll back state and rendered configs so the UI does not show changes that failed to apply.
- Runtime apply errors now return server errors for mutating API calls instead of looking like validation failures.
- Web UI closes the active dialog and refreshes state after apply failures so runtime errors are visible.
- Web UI now automatically starts the `.conf` download after a client is created successfully.
- Removed experimental QR generation, QR API routes, and QR actions from the Web UI. `.conf` download is now the only supported client import path.
- Origin/Host validation is stricter:
  - same-origin public requests are allowed;
  - localhost and SSH tunnel usage remain supported;
  - opaque origins such as `null` and browser-extension origins are rejected for mutating requests;
  - POST requests without Origin/Referer are only allowed for loopback hosts.

### Notes

- awg-forge only detects AmneziaWG upstream updates. It never updates tools inside a running container.
- AmneziaWG upgrades remain manual: update pinned refs, rebuild the Docker image, test real tunnels/clients, then release a new awg-forge image.

## v0.3.1 - 2026-05-19

Web UI typography and diagnostics polish.

### Added

- Bundled local JetBrains Mono webfont assets for offline-safe Web UI rendering in Docker and embedded deployments.
- Added `@font-face` definitions for JetBrains Mono Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.
- Added monospace diagnostic message styling for Doctor output.
- Added reusable `code`, `pre`, `kbd`, `samp`, and `.mono` typography rules for config-like values and diagnostic text.

### Changed

- Updated the UI monospace stack to prefer local JetBrains Mono before system monospace fallbacks.
- Improved readability of endpoints, subnets, DNS values, MTU values, interfaces, client addresses, and Doctor messages.
- Rendered Doctor result messages as compact diagnostic blocks with preserved line breaks and better wrapping.
- Improved modal scrolling behavior on smaller screens.
- Improved toast animation by replacing `display` toggling with opacity and transform transitions.
- Disabled monospace ligatures for `.mono` values so IPs, ports, subnets, and config fragments remain visually exact.

### Notes

- No backend routes, API payloads, storage format, tunnel rendering, protocol generation, or firewall behavior changed in this release.
- JetBrains Mono is served locally from `/static/fonts/` and does not require CDN access.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-05-19

Web UI refresh.

### Added

- New polished Web UI visual system with glass-style topbar, profile tabs, panels, dialogs, and toast surfaces.
- Inline awg-forge shield mark in the login and dashboard headers.
- Topbar theme toggle with sun/moon icons and persisted light/dark theme selection.
- Subtle pointer parallax for background lighting, grid layers, and major UI surfaces on desktop pointer devices.
- Light/dark theme tokens with semantic colors, focus rings, and reduced-transparency fallbacks.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support that disables decorative motion and interaction scaling.
- Clearer status indicators for tunnel state, client enabled state, stale configs, and health values.

### Changed

- Improved dashboard spacing and layout rhythm so topbar, profile tabs, and content panels no longer overlap.
- Reworked responsive layout for mobile screens, including stacked toolbar actions, forms, tunnel facts, and client rows.
- Limited tunnel cards to two columns on wide screens, expanded single-tunnel views to full width, and used one column on narrower screens for better readability.
- Simplified empty tunnel states to avoid looking like drop zones and kept a single `Create tunnel` action per profile.
- Improved modal headers and close controls while preserving existing API behavior and form flows.
- Rendered endpoint, subnet, DNS, MTU, interface, and client address values with monospace styling for easier scanning.
- Improved login layout, tunnel cards, client list headers, QR panels, doctor output, and health panels.

### Notes

- No backend routes, API payloads, storage format, or protocol rendering behavior changed in this release.
- The frontend remains plain embedded HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no Node, npm, React, Vue, Tailwind, or build pipeline.

## v0.2.2 - 2026-05-19

Firewall reconciliation and client health diagnostics.

### Added

- Per-tunnel Web UI Health action that samples runtime client counters and reports handshake, rx/tx totals, rx/tx deltas, and connection status.
- Client health warnings for handshake-only connections and cases where clients send traffic but the server sends no bytes back.
- Idle clients with a fresh handshake are now reported as `idle, handshake ok` instead of a warning.
- Tiny client rx deltas below 1 KiB are treated as idle noise instead of NAT/forwarding failures.
- Doctor checks for per-tunnel `MASQUERADE` and `FORWARD` firewall rules.
- Tests for runtime transfer counter parsing and AWG 1.5 idempotent firewall rendering.

### Fixed

- Tunnel settings changes can no longer leave stale NAT/firewall rules from an older subnet, port, or interface.
- Firewall rules are now reconciled during apply/sync, including `awg syncconf` paths where `PostUp` is not re-run by `awg-quick`.
- `PostUp` rules are idempotent and inserted before UFW/Docker forwarding rejects.
- `PostDown` removes duplicate awg-forge firewall rules left by older versions.
- The firewall fix applies to Legacy / 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 tunnels.

## v0.2.1 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Doctor runtime diagnostics for tunnel links, `awg show` port matching, runtime peers, stale client configs, handshakes, and transfer counters.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-18

AWG 2.0 release.

### Added

- AWG 2.0 profile support with `S3/S4`, ranged `H1-H4`, `I1-I5`, validation, and golden tests.
- AWG 2.0 tunnel creation through the existing multi-profile UI.
- AWG 2.0 `.conf` import validated on desktop and iOS clients with compatible AmneziaVPN builds.

### Notes

- `.conf` remains the recommended import path.
- QR import remains experimental until native Amnezia QR schema is verified across platforms.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-18

Initial public release of awg-forge.

### Added

- Go backend and CLI under module `github.com/astronaut808/awg-forge`.
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript Web UI for managing tunnels and clients.
- Multi-profile tunnel model with parallel tunnels for:
  - AmneziaWG Legacy / 1.0;
  - AmneziaWG 1.5-oriented profile;
  - AmneziaWG 2.0 placeholder for future work.
- Client lifecycle:
  - create clients;
  - delete clients;
  - enable and disable clients;
  - download `.conf` files;
  - show AmneziaVPN QR import codes.
- Protocol parameter generation and validation with non-zero obfuscation defaults.
- AWG 1.5 client-side `I1-I5` signature packet defaults.
- Tunnel settings for port, subnet, DNS, allowed IPs, keepalive, MTU, and enabled state.
- Config rendering for server and client files with private output permissions.
- JSON state storage with rendered tunnel/client config files.
- Docker image workflow for `linux/amd64`.
- Host-network and bridge-network Docker Compose examples.
- Doctor command and UI view for runtime checks.
- Login, session cookies, CSRF-style Origin/Host checks, security headers, and rate limiting.
- Idempotency keys for mutating UI requests to prevent duplicate creates on double-click.
- Stale-client indicators when tunnel settings or protocol params require fresh client configs.
- State backups before tunnel deletion and protocol auto-repair.

### Changed

- UI sessions expire after 30 minutes.
- Client configs render interface addresses with `/32`.
- Protocol validation now rejects out-of-range values such as `Jc > 10` and `S1/S2 > 64`.
- Existing states with older out-of-range protocol params are repaired on startup and backed up.

### Notes

- `.conf` file import is the recommended client import path.
- QR import is experimental on AmneziaVPN for iOS. If a QR-imported profile appears connected but does not start the iOS system VPN tunnel, delete it and import the `.conf` file instead.
- AmneziaWG 2.0 is not implemented in this release.
